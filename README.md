This repository contains the main code to run the Paran치 Delta Burned Area App in the Google Earth Engine environment. All the code was written using the JavaScript GEE API. 

## About the app

The Paran치 Delta Burned Area App allows users to easily visualize the burned area and its temporal and spatial distribution along the Paran치 River Delta, Argentina, during the period 2001-2022. It also provide valuable insights about vegetation conditions and humidity
